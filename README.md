# DOMATT -- Typed DOM Attributes for WASM apps written in Rust

Domatt is an HTML attribute library for writing web applications in Rust.
It aims to provide a type-safe way of setting DOM attributes so that
you don't have to worry about accidentally providing invalid values as
may happen when simply setting these values using strings.
